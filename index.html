  <p><span class="first-sentence">Weekend hackups are a monthly excuse to make
  something cool.</span> They are about creating
  instead of axe-sharpening. Hackups are inspired by rapid prototyping, rough
  cuts, and the 80-20 rule: it should only take 20% of the time to implement
  80% of functionality, so let's crank the 80 in a weekend and make some shit
  already.</p>

  <h2>It's simple</h2>

  <ol> 
    <li><p>Hackups start at 8PM on Fridays, end on Sunday at 5PM, when a
    show-off and recap is held. All participants must show off.</p></li>

    <li><p>Participants must enter the hackup with an idea of what they want to
    make.</p></li>

    <li><p>Participants must do their best to complete an implementation of that
    idea.</p></li>

    <li><p>Drinking beer is allowed. Pizza is encouraged.</p></li>
  </ol></p>

  <p>Ideas can be anything, often code-related, but you've gotta have something
  to show for the weekend.</p>
